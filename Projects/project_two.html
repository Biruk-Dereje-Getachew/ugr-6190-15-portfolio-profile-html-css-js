      <h1 class="main-header">Lorenz's Attractor</h1>
      <div class="project-description__passage">
        <p>
          <strong>The Lorenz Attractor</strong> is a set of chaotic solutions to a system of three differential
          equations first introduced by Edward Lorenz in 1963. This mathematical model describes the behavior of a
          simplified weather system and has since become one of the most famous examples of deterministic chaos. The
          Lorenz Attractor is visually represented as a three-dimensional trajectory that resembles a butterfly or
          figure-eight pattern. Despite being governed by deterministic equations, the Lorenz system exhibits extreme
          sensitivity to initial conditions, which is a hallmark of chaotic systems.
        </p>

        <h3>The Mathematical Model</h3>
        <p>
          The Lorenz system consists of three coupled, non-linear differential equations that describe the rate of
          change of three variables—usually denoted as <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>—over time. These variables
          can represent physical quantities such as convection in fluids, with parameters controlling aspects like the
          intensity of the system. The equations are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>dx/dt = σ(y - x):</strong> Describes the rate of change in the x-direction based on the difference
            between x and y, with σ representing the Prandtl number.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>dy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y:</strong> Represents the rate of change in the y-direction, influenced by both
            x and z, with ρ being the Rayleigh number.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>dz/dt = xy - βz:</strong> Models the change in the z-direction, with β determining the dissipation
            of the system.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With specific parameter values—such as σ = 10, ρ = 28, and β = 8/3—the system produces the iconic chaotic
          "butterfly" attractor, a structure that never repeats but remains confined to a finite space.
        </p>

        <h3>Significance and Chaos Theory</h3>
        <p>
          The Lorenz Attractor is a cornerstone in the field of chaos theory, illustrating how simple deterministic
          systems can lead to complex and unpredictable behavior. Its sensitivity to initial conditions is often
          described as the "butterfly effect," where small differences in starting points can lead to drastically
          different outcomes. This concept has profound implications in fields like weather prediction, fluid dynamics,
          and even economics, where systems are influenced by multiple interdependent variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          The attractor has also inspired researchers and artists alike, due to its elegant structure and chaotic
          nature. In scientific research, it provides insights into non-linear dynamics and systems with unpredictable
          yet bounded behavior. In the visual arts, it serves as a fascinating example of how mathematical equations can
          create intricate and mesmerizing patterns.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          The Lorenz Attractor is more than a mathematical curiosity—it is a symbol of the beauty and complexity that
          can arise from chaos. Its discovery marked a turning point in our understanding of deterministic systems and
          their unpredictable behaviors. Today, it remains a widely studied phenomenon, bridging the gap between
          science, mathematics, and art.
