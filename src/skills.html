          <h4>Programming Languages</h4>
          <p class="technical-skills-section__list__item__left__passage">
            I am comfortable with Java, Python, and JavaScript, having gained experience through small projects and
            scripts. Each language has its strengths and use cases, and I have worked with them in different contexts to
            sharpen my programming skills. I particularly enjoy solving algorithmic challenges and building small
            applications to better understand how these languages work.<br /><br />

            In addition, I am familiar with object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, such as classes, objects,
            inheritance, and polymorphism, and I have applied these in my projects. I have also delved into web
            development basics, using JavaScript for front-end tasks and Python for backend scripting. Through hands-on
            practice, I am constantly improving and exploring new ways to utilize these languages for real-world
            projects.

          <h4>Mathematical Expertise</h4>
          <p class="technical-skills-section__list__item__right__passage">
            I have a strong foundation in algebra, trigonometry, and calculus. These concepts are fundamental to
            problem-solving in both academic and programming contexts. I often apply my mathematical knowledge to coding
            challenges, especially those that require optimization or the creation of efficient algorithms.<br /><br />

            Through my academic journey and programming experiences, I have become confident in implementing
            mathematical algorithms to tackle real-world problems, whether in data analysis, simulations, or
            computations. I enjoy using mathematical tools and techniques to analyze data, identify patterns, and create
            effective solutions that are both scalable and reliable.

          <h4>Data Structures and Algorithms</h4>
          <p class="technical-skills-section__list__item__left__passage">
            I have a solid understanding of core data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and
            trees, as well as algorithms like sorting, searching, and recursion. These foundational elements are crucial
            for solving computational problems efficiently. I apply them regularly in competitive programming and coding
            challenges to refine my problem-solving abilities.<br /><br />

            While my knowledge of data structures and algorithms is still evolving, I am actively developing my skills
            by working through coding challenges on platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, and HackerRank. I am
            continuously learning how to optimize algorithms and select the most appropriate data structure for
            different problem scenarios.

          <h4>Version Control</h4>
          <p class="technical-skills-section__list__item__right__passage">
            I have basic experience using Git for version control, which is essential for managing code in collaborative
            environments. I am familiar with the process of committing changes, pushing to remote repositories, and
            managing different branches of a project. This allows me to keep track of changes, collaborate effectively
            with others, and maintain the integrity of my codebase.<br /><br />

            Additionally, I have experience with GitHub, which I use to share code, contribute to open-source projects,
            and collaborate with other developers. While I am familiar with the basic functionalities of Git and GitHub,
            I am currently learning more advanced features like branching, merging, and resolving conflicts to enhance
            my version control workflow.
